#### Known bugs and stuff
1. No Cyrillic Alphabet support (probably other types are gonna break too)
2. I made with Windows support in mind, so i made a test in linux and boom! a directory '\\config' was created while everything else was '/config' (im so stupid)
3. probably some other stuff as well because it was my first mod and im bad at coding


Currently works for 1.19.3, I don't know about porting because this is my first mod, but I guess I could try porting to 1.20 as soon as Fabric gets updated.  
I can help you if there's anything related to the mod in my Discord, just send me a message:  vczoika#9796
